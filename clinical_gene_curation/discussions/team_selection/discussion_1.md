This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project exploring how AI may be helpful with tumor mutation curation and its potential to help enhance the speed of clinical assay reporting. Precisely, how can we use machine learning to develop a new machine learning algorithm to aid in genetic mutation curation in the clinical setting for identifying mutations that are clinically actionable treatment decisions and inform prognosis. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the mutation curation process design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to genomics research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for genomics, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

1. Agent(
    title="Bioinformatics Scientist",
    expertise="genomic data analysis and interpretation",
    goal="develop computational methods for analyzing large-scale genomic data",
    role="analyze genomic datasets, provide insights on mutation patterns, and validate algorithm efficacy"
)

2. Agent(
    title="Clinical Geneticist",
    expertise="clinical genomics and genetic counseling",
    goal="translate genomic findings into clinically actionable insights",
    role="advise on clinical relevance of mutations, ensure alignment with clinical standards, and help bridge lab findings with patient care"
)

3. Agent(
    title="Machine Learning Engineer",
    expertise="developing and implementing machine learning models",
    goal="design and optimize AI algorithms for biomedical applications",
